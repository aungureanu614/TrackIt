##Background

I built this app as a way to keep track of my wish list of places to visit, books to read and restaurants to try.

##Use Case

Why is this app useful? If you're like me and constantly come across things that you want to check out later only to forget about them when you actually have the time to do them, then this app is for you. 
You should probably also enjoy reading, traveling and eating.

##Working Prototype

You can access a working prototype of the app here: https://pure-fortress-13675.herokuapp.com/

##Functionality
The app's functionality includes:

* Adding, editing and deleting books, places and restaurants to a list
* Storing items in a MongoDB 

##Technical

The app is built using:

* MongoDB 
* Mongoose
* Node.js
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

##Development Roadmap

Future features to be added to the app are:

* Creating a way for users to log in and see their unique information
* A way to create several lists that can be saved for future retrieval
* A way to keep track of the items you've completed
* Setting goals for a timeframe of completion
